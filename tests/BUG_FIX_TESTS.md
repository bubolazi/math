# Bug Fix Test Cases

This document describes the test cases added to prevent the three bugs from recurring.

## Overview

Added 16 new test cases (from 41 to 57 total tests) to cover the three bugs that were fixed:

1. **Bug 1**: Place Value Level 2 - No new problem generation after completion
2. **Bug 2**: Navigation stack prevents return to subject list
3. **Bug 3**: Input conflicts when switching between activities

## Test Files Modified/Created

### 1. `tests/math-operations.test.js`
Added a new test suite: **Bug Fix - Place Value Level 2 Completion** with 4 tests:

- `Place Value Level 2 problem has currentStep property set to 1`
  - Verifies that newly generated Place Value Level 2 problems start at step 1
  - Ensures stepAnswers array has exactly 4 elements

- `Place Value Level 2 problem marks completion with currentStep=5 after all steps`
  - Simulates completing all 4 steps
  - Verifies that currentStep=5 indicates completion
  - This prevents Bug #1 from recurring

- `Multiple Place Value problems can be generated in sequence`
  - Generates first problem, marks it complete with currentStep=5
  - Generates second problem and verifies it starts fresh at step 1
  - Ensures problems are different
  - Critical test for Bug #1 fix

- `Place Value Level 2 stepAnswers are correct for all 4 steps`
  - Validates the correctness of step answers
  - Ensures step 1 = ones sum, step 2 = carry over, step 3 = tens sum + carry, step 4 = final answer

### 2. `tests/navigation.test.js`
Updated MockController to match the bug fix and added/modified tests:

**MockController Changes:**
- `selectSubject()`: Now starts with empty stack `[]` instead of `['subject']`
- Added `initializeOperationSelection()`: Pushes 'subject' when showing operations screen

**Updated Tests (6 tests modified):**
- Navigation tests now properly test the fixed behavior
- Added explicit calls to `initializeOperationSelection()` where needed
- Updated assertions to reflect correct navigation stack states

**New Test:**
- `Bug fix: Can navigate back to subject list (empty stack)`
  - Navigates through subject → operations → activity
  - Navigates all the way back to empty stack
  - This test specifically validates Bug #2 fix

**Enhanced Tests (3 tests):**
- `Bug fix: Backspace navigates step by step, allowing return to subject list`
  - Tests complete navigation flow including reaching empty stack
  - Explicitly validates Bug #2 fix

- `Bug fix: Backspace preserves navigation state in Bulgarian activities`
  - Same as above but for Bulgarian subject
  - Includes navigation to empty stack

- `Bug fix: Navigation stack remains consistent after multiple back-and-forth navigations`
  - Tests complex navigation scenarios
  - Ensures stack remains consistent after multiple switches

### 3. `tests/input-handling.test.js` (NEW FILE)
Created comprehensive test suite for Bug #3 with 11 tests across 2 test suites:

**Bug Fix - Input Handling Across Activities (7 tests):**

- `Addition Level 1 generates valid problems with numeric answers`
  - Validates Addition problems have correct structure
  - Ensures answers are numbers and calculations are correct

- `Subtraction Level 1 generates valid problems with numeric answers`
  - Validates Subtraction problems have correct structure
  - Ensures answers are numbers and calculations are correct

- `Place Value Level 1 generates valid problems with numeric answers`
  - Validates Place Value recognition problems
  - Ensures answers are single digits (0-9)

- `Place Value Level 2 generates valid multi-step problems`
  - Validates multi-step Place Value problems
  - Ensures all step answers are numbers
  - Verifies currentStep starts at 1

- `Bug fix: Switching from Addition to Subtraction maintains correct problem generation`
  - Simulates switching activities
  - Verifies each activity generates correct problem types
  - Critical test for Bug #3

- `Bug fix: Switching from Addition to Place Value maintains correct problem generation`
  - Tests switching to multi-step activity
  - Ensures problem structures are different and correct

- `Bug fix: Multiple activity switches maintain correct answer validation`
  - Tests 4 activity switches: Addition → Subtraction → Place Value → Addition
  - Validates answer checking works correctly after each switch
  - Most comprehensive test for Bug #3

**Bug Fix - Bulgarian Language Input Handling (4 tests):**

- `Letters activity generates valid problems`
  - Validates Bulgarian language problems
  - Ensures answers are strings (letters)

- `Bug fix: Switching from Math to Bulgarian maintains correct problem generation`
  - Tests cross-subject switching (Math → Bulgarian)
  - Verifies answer types change correctly (number → string)
  - Addresses Bug #3 for cross-subject scenarios

- `Bug fix: Switching from Bulgarian to Math maintains correct problem generation`
  - Tests cross-subject switching (Bulgarian → Math)
  - Verifies answer types change correctly (string → number)

## Test Coverage Summary

### Bug #1: Place Value Level 2 Completion
- **Tests Added**: 4
- **Key Test**: "Multiple Place Value problems can be generated in sequence"
- **What It Prevents**: Problems getting stuck after completing step 4, with no new problem generated

### Bug #2: Navigation Back to Subject List
- **Tests Modified**: 9
- **Tests Added**: 1 explicit test
- **Key Test**: "Bug fix: Can navigate back to subject list (empty stack)"
- **What It Prevents**: Users being unable to navigate back to the subject selection screen

### Bug #3: Input Conflicts Between Activities
- **Tests Added**: 11 (new file)
- **Key Tests**: 
  - "Bug fix: Multiple activity switches maintain correct answer validation"
  - "Bug fix: Switching from Math to Bulgarian maintains correct problem generation"
- **What It Prevents**: Input not working or working incorrectly when switching between activities/levels due to event listener conflicts

## Running the Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Expected output:
```
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       57 passed, 57 total
```

## Test Maintenance

These tests should:
1. **Always pass** with the current code
2. **Fail** if any of the three bugs are reintroduced
3. Be **updated** if the navigation or problem generation logic changes significantly

## Why These Tests Matter

1. **Regression Prevention**: Automatically catches if someone accidentally reintroduces these bugs
2. **Documentation**: Serves as living documentation of the expected behavior
3. **Confidence**: Allows developers to refactor with confidence that they haven't broken these critical features
4. **CI/CD Integration**: These tests run automatically on every commit, catching issues early
